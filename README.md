Things to note when using this template:

* When importing an obj with the mtl file, make sure the mtl is referencing the right image texture location (img/<picture>).
   * See [this link](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/mtl/mtl.html) for more information regarding mtl files.
* If the imported obj file is rendering in another color (eg: green filter-like color), edit out the color values to the default.
   * See the link under the first bullet for info about default mtl values.
